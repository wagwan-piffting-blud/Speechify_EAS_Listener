"""
patch_speed.py -- Remove realtime throttle from SWIttsEngine.dll

The Speechify engine calls Sleep() after producing each audio chunk,
throttling synthesis to match realtime playback speed. This is useless
for file output and adds 35+ seconds to a 200-word synthesis.

The patch NOPs a single PUSH+CALL sequence (7 bytes at file offset
0x123DA) that calls kernel32.Sleep with the throttle duration.

Usage:
    1. Stop Speechify.exe
    2. python patch_speed.py
    3. Restart Speechify.exe
    4. Enjoy 14x faster synthesis

To restore: copy SWIttsEngine_orig.dll over SWIttsEngine.dll
